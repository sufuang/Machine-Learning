    "## Regularization - Penalize model coefficients to prevent overfitting  \n",
    "- Discourage large coefficients by dampening them\n",
    "- Remove features entirely by setting their coefficients to 0\n",
    "- The penalty is tunable \n",

    "## Ensembles  - Combine predictions from multiple separate models \n",
    "- Bagging : Reduce the chance overfitting complex models\n",
    "  - Uses complex base models and tries to \"smooth out\" predictions\n",
    "  - A strong learner : Relatively unconstrained model\n",
    "  - Trains a large number of \"strong\" learners in parallel\n",

    "##  Linear Regression\n",
    "- Fits a \"straight line\" or a hyperplane\n",
    "- Easy to interpret and understand\n",
    "- Overfit: A model performs very well on the training data but poorly on the test data\n",
    "- Prone to overfit with many input features\n",
    "- Cannot easily express non-linear relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three common types of regularized linear regression algorithms to prevent from overfitting\n",
    "1. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression\n",
    " - Penalizes the absolute size of coefficients : Leads to coefficients that can be exactly 0\n",
    " - Can completely remove some features and offers automatic feature selection\n",
    " - Should tune the \"strength\" of the penalty to lead more coefficients pushed to zero \n",
    "2. Ridge Regression\n",
    " - Penalizes the squared size of coefficients : Leads to smaller coefficients, but it doesn't force them to 0\n",
    " - Offers feature shrinkage\n",
    " - Should tune the \"strength\" of the penalty to leads more coefficients pushed closer to zero \n",
    "3. Elastic-Net  \n",
    " - A compromise between Lasso and Ridge\n",
    " - Elastic-Net penalizes a mix of both absolute and squared size\n",
    " - Should tune the ratio of the two penalty types and overall strength \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree\n",
    "- Flexibility: The hierarchical branching structure can easily model nonlinear relationships\n",
    "- Individual unconstrained decision trees are prone to being overfit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two ensembled trees to prevent from overfitting\n",
    "1. Random forests\n",
    " - Train a large number of \"strong\" decision trees and combine their predictions through bagging\n",
    " - Feature selection: Each tree is only allowed to choose from a random subset of features to split on \n",
    " - Resampling: Each tree is only trained on a random subset of observations \n",
    " - Beat many other models and get good results\n",
    " - Not have many complicated parameters to tune\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Boosted trees\n",
    " - Train a sequence of \"weak\", constrained decision trees and combine their predictions through boosting\n",
    " - Should tune a maximum depth for each tree\n",
    " - Correct the prediction errors of the one before it\n",
    " - Tend to have the highest performance ceilings\n",
    " - Often beat many other types of models after proper tuning\n",
    " - More complicated to tune than random forests\n",
